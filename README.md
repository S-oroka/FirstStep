***
## ***Checklist***
* [] Be written using the languages and frameworks learned in this course so far
* [] Not be written using any other languages or frameworks not covered in this course so far (TypeScript, Sass, jQuery, UI Frameworks, etc.)
* [] Have a separate directory for the frontend (client) and have your backend within the main repository.
* [] Your README should have your name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
* [] Include a minimum of 2 Mongoose Schemas (models)
* [] Have Full CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations
* [] Display data from each model on the frontend (unless given an exemption on one by an Instructor)
* [] Must be able to navigate between different pages (React Router)
* [] Have at least 40 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
* [] Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
* [] Be deployed on Heroku
